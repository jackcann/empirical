    "# Competitivity in Europes 5 biggest football leagues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: which league title is the most competitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Competitiveness is a crucial part of football and is the second most important metric by which quality of a league is assessed, after team's ability. Among all forms of competition within a league, the title race holds the most significance. It makes headlines, fuels fairytale stories (such as Leicester City's Premier League win), and legitimises the existence of club football.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies investigating the competitiveness of the major European league titles have contradicted popular opinion. For example, a study by the well-respected sports newspaper *The Athletic* found Ligue 1 to be the most competitive of the major European leagues. This study flipped popular opinion on its head and demonstrates the necessity of empiricism when evaluating something as emotionally charged as sport.\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "Following in the footsteps of the study by *The Athletic* this blog aims to quantitively measure the competitiveness of each major European league title. \n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data analysed covers the last 15 sesasons for each league. This time span was selected as it defines an era in the competitiveness of football. In 2011 Serie A introduced financial fairplay rules, and the other leagues shortly followed suit, teams could no longer buy their way out of competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competetiveness index\n",
    "To assess the competition for a given league's title we will use an index made up of 3 components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*0.25 x (number of title contenders) + 0.25 x (1-average winning margin) + 0.5 x (1-titles won by dominant team)* \n",
    "#### Definitions\n",
    "Number of title contenders: The average number of teams within 3 points of the league winner in a given season\n",
    "\n",
    "Average winning margin: The margin of points between 1st and second place at the end of a season\n",
    "\n",
    "Titles won by dominant team: The proportion of titles won by the most successful team during the period\n",
    "#### Weigthing\n",
    "While number of title contenders and average winning margin are both important measures of competitiveness they are highly correlated, so they are weighted such that they hold the same weight together as \"titles won by dominant team\".\n",
    "#### Normalisation and scaling\n",
    "All variables are normalised such that the best performing league in each metric gets a score of 1, the worst gets 0, and others are scaled proportionally. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average winning margin is adjusted based on the number of matches played in a season, as more matches and therefore points will inflate a win margin proportionally.\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "It is also important to acknowledge the limitations of this index. This index does not tell us how probable it is a team from the middle or bottom of the table can win the league, but rather the uncertainty with which you can predict one given title winner. For a dominant team this index captures on average whether they face competition, whether they win comfortably and how often they win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results for the index are below:"

    "### Results\n",
    "These results seem to largely affirm popular perception with La Liga and the Premier league dominanting the index. The unparalleled competitiveness between Barcelona and Real Madrid has placed La Liga on top, this rivalry makes it very hard to predict which of the two will win a given season, hence we see narrow winning margins and low levels of one team dominance in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The premier league in second benefits from the fact unlike other leagues it tends to go through eras of different teams being dominant, giving it a good score in the \"titles won by dominant teams\" metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "The unwavering dominance of PSG and Bayern Munich respectively place Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga at the bottom of the table, as would be expected. These two leagues are characterised by huge win margins by their top clubs, little variation in title winning teams and few contenders for titles.\n",

    "## Part 2: how has overall competitiveness in the 5 major leagues changed over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The financial fair play regulations implemented at the beginning of the selected 15 year data period reflect a perennial worry in football, that league competitiveness is diminishing over time. In spite of these rules, more successful teams continue to get richer through performance-based access to hugely profitable competitions such as the champions league and merchandise sales meanwhile smaller teams fall behind with no opportunity to spend in order to catch up. As financial fair play permits spending according to revenues, it is ineffective at solving this problem. Over time this results in a decrease in the general competitiveness of footballing leagues, making the game uninteresting for those supporting teams not at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "The aim of this section is to determine whether the decreasing competitiveness of footballing leagues is a real phenomenon, and by extension whether the implementation of financial fair play rules has been enough to mitigate the decline in competition across Europes 5 major leagues. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "#### HHI index\n",
    "Competitiveness will be quantified using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) which is traditionally used in economics for measuring market competition by analysing the concerntration of market share, in this case market share will be substituted for points share. \n",
    "#### Normalisation\n",
    "HHI will have to be normalised, as different leagues have different numbers of teams. For example, the Bundesliga has 18 teams meanwhile the premier league has 20 so one teams point share, which HHI measures, will be more diluted in the premier league than in the Bundesliga without normalisation."

    "### Graph interpretation\n",
    "Two things are interesting about this graph. Firstly, there is a lot of noise in the HHI index for any given league across the seasons and no discernable divergence between leagues. This suggests there aren't league specific trends to changes in competitiveness, and rather any trends identified span all leagues. The only exception to this is La Liga which had a unique and somewhat sustained boost to competitiveness after 2015, potentially attributable to the financial issues faced by Barcelona. Secondly, we can see a increase in HHI across all leagues, this indicates a full in competitiveness and more specifically the increasing dominance of a select few teams. The trend does appear to be a decrease in competitivity. According to this metric declining competitiveness in football is a real phenomenon, and financial fairplay has been insufficient at completely stopping it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient indicates a moderate positive relationship between time, increased HHI and decreased competitivity.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Graph interpretation\n",
    "This graph shows clearly how uniform the decrease in competitivity across in all leagues barring La Liga is. This indicates issue spans leagues and does not occur within leagues. The decline in competitiveness is indicative of continent wide issues in football.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2 conclusion:\n",
    "The decline in competitiveness across European football appears to be real and a continent wide issue, not confined to any single league. Addressing this issue requires a unilateral approach. Financial fair play regulations have proven insufficient in entirely mitigating increasing uncompetitiveness, suggesting that either stricter enforcement or greater support for smaller clubs is necessary. The recent introduction of the new Club World Cup, restricted to historically successful teams and offering them yet another exclusive revenue stream, will only increase this imbalance. The actions of European footballing authorities, such as UEFA, therefore seem to be in contradiction with the trends identified in this blog, and change is needed."
